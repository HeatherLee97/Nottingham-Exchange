## Reporting a Vulnerability

We do not push anything with substance until security has been set up. If we notice a push does not enter the "Test" branch first (or goes directly to "Main" without 
review), have everyone IMMEDIATELY stop updating branches and conviene on discord. 

Discuss with a minimum of 3 collaborators to fix issue via discord, and create an issue in GitHub to resolve together and have the 3rd person review the other 2's work.
